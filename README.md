##  Finding the topper in each subject
    Time Complexity
        O(m*n) where m is the number of subjects and n is the number of students.
        Here I consider the number of subjects to be constant.
        Therefore the time complexity is O(n)
     Space Complexity
        O(n) where n is the number of students

##  Finding the top 3 students
     Time Complexity  
        O(nlog(n)) where n is the number of students
    Space Complexity is 
        O(n) where n is the number of students
